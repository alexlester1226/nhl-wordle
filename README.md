# PUCKLE 🏒

PUCKLE is a hockey-themed guessing game inspired by Wordle — but instead of guessing words, you’re guessing **NHL players**!

## 🧠 How It Works

Each day, a new NHL player is secretly selected as the "answer." Your goal is to guess who it is by typing in the names of NHL players.

For each guess, you’ll get feedback by category:

| Category     | Meaning if Colored |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 🟩 Green     | Correct match      |
| 🟧 Orange    | Close (e.g., same division or ±2 years of age) |
| ⬛ Black     | No match           |

### Categories:
- **Team**: 🟧 if same division
- **Age**: 🟧 if within ±2 years
- **Height**: 🟧 if same foot height (e.g., 5'8 and 5'10)
- **Weight**: 🟧 if within ±15 lbs
- **Handedness**, **Nationality**, **Position**: 🟩 if exact match
- **Name**: 🟩 only when you've guessed the exact player
